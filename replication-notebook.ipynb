    "Chen et. al. (2020) examine the effects of China’s civil examination system (keju), a long-lived institution, on human capital outcome todays. Becoming dominant from Song dynasty (c. 960–1276), Keju is the earliest elite selection system in the world, which aims to recruit talents to serve in the bureaucracy. Since Jinshi is the highest honor and qualification in this civil exam, passing the highest level of the exam and receiving the position of Jinshi mean generous pecuniary rewards and a promising future. Over time, the civil examination system formed a distinct group of local elites with deep respect for learning and academic achievements. This cultural characteristic still existed for a long time even after the abolition of the imperial examination system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the causal relationship between keju and contemporary human capital outcome, Chen et. al. (2020) introduce an **instrumental variable (IV)** - Distance to the Printing Ingredients (Pine and Bamboo) to tackle the issues of omitted variables bias. The IV is motivated by the idea that to become a winner in the Keju exam, except the limited textbooks, the candidates still need a large cluster of reference books, which explain nuances of texts and teach tricks of writing essay. That is why printing ingredients play such an important role in the Keju exam. At the end, Chen et. al. (2020) present the causality and compare OLS and TSLS using different control variables.\n",

The fourth section and the fifth section, as the core of this notebook, show the replication of main results in the paper and try to solve possible problems with weak instruments, xxx and xxx. The sixth section concludes. The seventh section offers some reference."

    "Chen et. al. (2020) in their paper aim to verify whether the relationship between keju and contemporary human capital outcome is causal. However, performance i.e. Jinshi density of various prefectures may be related to many complicated factors. So the estimates of contemporary human capital outcomes to Keju are likely to suffer from omitted variable - variables that are simultaneously associated with both historical jinshi density and years of schooling today. Unobserved factors, like natural or genetic endowments, may be associated with prefectures that had produced more jinshi. Natural or genetic endowments are hard to measure and therefore it is not possible to control for them, when estimating the contemporary human capital outcomes to Keju. Thus, an omitted variable bias might occur. To deal with this concern, an instrumental variable approach is employed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chen et. al. (2020) examine the effects of China’s civil examination system using data from in the Ming-Qing period (c. 1368–1905). In such a context, the printing technology in China relied mainly on pine and bamboo for producing ink and paper. Typically, the printing centers were located near to the pine and bamboo habitats to reduce the transport costs. Besides, for geographical reasons, the transportation of raw materials i.e. pine and bamboo products was mostly finished via waterways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, an instrumental variable is constructed using a prefecture’s shortest river distance to its nearest sites of pine and bamboo — the two key ingredients required for producing ink and paper in woodblock printing. The following is the logic that why this instrumental variable is feasible and reasonable. 1) To some extent, the performance of various Chinese prefectures in the Keju exam is closely related to the convenience of printing and obtaining books, not only textbooks but also reference books. 2) The main printing centers were located in close to the producing areas of pine and bamboo. 3) The raw materials needed for printing were mainly transported by water via the main river branches. Since the geographic distributions of pine and bamboo forests are random, the exogeneity assumption of the instrumental variable holds.  \n"
