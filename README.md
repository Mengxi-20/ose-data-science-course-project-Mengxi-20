# Student project: Replication of Chen et. al. (2020) 

This is the final project of the OSE data science course summerterm 2021 by Mengxi Wang.

## Project overview

This repository contains my replication of the main results from [Chen, T., Kung, J. K. S., & Ma, C. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaa043). Long Live Keju! The Persistent Effects of China’s Civil Examination System. The Economic Journal, 130(631), 2030–2064.

Chen et al. (2020) offered an ingenious design and an interesting application of instrumental variables. This observation of a strong, positive relationship between prefectures with a strong historical tradition of exam success and current years of schooling enabled Chen et al. (2020) to contribute important insights to the persistent impact of a remarkably long-lived institution — imperial China’s civil service examination system — methods of selecting candidates or current educational attainment. Moreover, Chen et al. (2020) further demonstrated that this relationship is causal by using the average river distance to a prefecture’s nearest pine and bamboo forests as an instrument, which produced the main tools for printing.
